A project for the University of Groningen course “Logical Aspects of
Multi-Agent Systems” exploring agent knowledge in distributed systems with
semi-public announcements.

## Planning
At this point the project is far from finished. Here are a couple of points that we intend to add before the final deadline:
 - (Report) Full definitions and natationary conventions of (dynamic epistemic) gossip. We are aware that the graders are not proficient in this field;
 - The update pipeline, including the updating of the gossip graph given a new (group) call, and the updating of the underlying knowledge structure. For the latter, we intend to use ```SMCDEL``` and action models;
 - A user interface, allowing the user to specify an initial gossip graph, and trigger updates through a (group) call;
 - A visualization pipeline, allowing insights in the gossip state and agents' knowledge thereof, at any given point in the process;
 - Heuristics, a quasi-protocol where a system points the user to beneficial calls to make, and explains its reasoning;
 - Full epistemic protocols (possibly derived from already existing ones) that are able to adequately deal with the addition of group calls.
