# Epistemic Group Gossip

## Building

If you want to try the tool, make sure you have the [Haskell Tool Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/#how-to-install) installed first. After that, you can run `stack build` to build the project (might take a couple of minutes the first time) and `stack run` to run the project.

## Running the app

Currently when you run `stack run` you are presented with a command-line interface (CLI) in which you can work on two predefined gossip graphs. You can

1. Execute calls
2. View possible calls
3. View the current state

The current state will show you the current gossip graph, the current knowledge structure (WIP) and the call sequence so far.

### Executable

We are working on providing executables for Linux, macOS and Windows. These will be made available under [Releases](./releases).
